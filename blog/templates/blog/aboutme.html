<h2>About Me</h2>				
<p>Hello my name is Christian Kim and I am a recent George Mason University graduate. I earned a degree in Information Technlogy, but I wanted to prove that I have a foundational knowledge in cybersecurity so that is why I have been studying for the CompTIA Security 601 exam. Something interesting about me is that I like to play sports such as basketball and flag football. </p>
<p>Just to let you know if you're intimidated by the amount of material covered in CompTIA Security+, don't be. You don't have to be the smartest person in the world to pass, trust me I'm no genius. I believe that study habits, dedication, and focusing on effective study strategies will allow you to pass. I'm going to share some of my recommendations for how you should prepare and study for the CompTIA Security+ exam:</p>

<h3>My Study Recommendations:</h3>
    
<p><b>1. Get used to the information:</b> I would recommend reading a textbook or watching all of Professor Messers videos in 1.5x speed. This will provide you with general information and get you used to the acronyms and vocab words</p>
          
<p><b>2. Take Quizzes:</b> After reading/watching each sections, I would recommend taking quizzes to test your knowledge. Memorizing the vocab words is one thing, but it's also important to test your understanding of the topics. It's also important to to go back to each question and try to understand why you either got the answer correct or incorrect. </p>

<p><b>3. Practice, Practice, Practice:</b> Once you have gone through each section, I would recommend to focus on taking practice exams that simulate the real exam. Again, you should review not only your incorrect answers, but also your incorrect answers to have an understanding of the topics. </p>

<p><b>4. Hands-On Learning:</b> The CompTIA Security+ exam will not only be multiple choice, but also have performance based questions (PBQs). Having hands on labs to practice with will help you pass the exam!</p>
            
<p><b>5. Watch Videos and Understand PBQs:</b> Watching videos, especially those that explain Performance-Based Questions (PBQs), is very important. PBQs test your ability to apply knowledge in practical scenarios, which is a key part of the Security+ exam.</p>

<p><b>5. Watch Cyber Crafts PBQs explanation videos:</b> Watching these videos explaining the PBQs is very important. Cyber Craft goes through differing topics of PBQs that may be on your exam. These will not only test your practical knowledge, but help you learn topics that you may be confused about. </p>

            
<p><b>6. Aim for 90% on Practice Exams:</b> You should aim to average about 90% on the practice exams. This will give you confidence that you have a strong understanding of the concepts, topics, and prove to yourself that you will pass the real exam.</p>

<p><b>7. The Comptia Security+ Exam is expensive:</b>A single exam voucher costs $404 dollars. Make sure you prepare and study hard, so that you won't have to retake the exam! Also, student discounts are available!</p>
            
<p>I believe these study strategies will help you prepare to take the CompTIA Security+ exam. Remember you have to be consistent and not just memorize the vocab words. Having an understanding of the concepts is key!</p>
