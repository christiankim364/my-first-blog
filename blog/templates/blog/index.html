                <p><strong>Welcome to My Security+ Django Blog!</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Hi My name is Christian Kim and I made this blog to mark my first project using Django, a robust and secure web framework built with Python. Here, I share my journey and provide insights about preparing for the CompTIA Security+ certification exam. To access the full content, please log in or sign up to become an authorized user.

                    This website has been built with several security features to safeguard user data and maintain a strong security posture. Some of the key measures implemented include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>User Authentication and Authorization:</strong> Secure registration, login, and logout functionalities ensure that only authorized users can access restricted content. Additionally, pages are protected so that unauthorized users cannot bypass login requirements by directly inputting URLs.</li>
                    <li><strong>HTTPS Enforcement:</strong> All traffic to and from the site is encrypted using HTTPS, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Session Management:</strong> Secure session cookies with attributes like HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).</li>
                    <li><strong>Password Security:</strong> Passwords are hashed using Djangoâ€™s built-in PBKDF2 password hashing algorithm, adding an extra layer of security.</li>
                    <li><strong>Content Security Policy (CSP):</strong> A Content Security Policy is implemented to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks by controlling the sources from which resources can be loaded.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    By integrating these security best practices, this project demonstrates how Django can be used to build secure, resilient web applications.
